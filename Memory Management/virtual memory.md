# **Virtual memory**
- Virtual memory is a memory management technique used by operating systems that gives an illusion of a large, continuous main memory to programs, even if the actual physical memory (RAM) is limited.

- It allows the system to execute processes that may not be completely loaded into RAM, by using disk space (usually called a swap file or page file) as an extension of RAM.

## **Why Virtual Memory is Important**

| Benefit                     | Description                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Runs Large Applications** | Supports processes larger than physical RAM.                  |
| **Efficient Multitasking**  | Enables more processes to run at the same time.               |
| **Memory Isolation**        | Keeps one process from accessing another's memory.            |
| **Simplified Programming**  | Programmers don’t need to worry about physical memory limits. |

## **How Virtual Memory Works (Step-by-Step)**
- Address Translation:
 - CPU generates a virtual address.
 - The OS uses the page table to translate it into a physical address.

- Page Replacement:
 - If a page needed by a process is not in RAM, it causes a page fault.
 - The OS brings the page from secondary storage (disk) into RAM.
 - If RAM is full, the OS swaps out a less-used page to disk (using algorithms like LRU, FIFO).

- Swapping:
 - Data is moved between RAM and disk as needed.

## **Key Componnets**

| Component            | Role                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Virtual Address**  | Generated by CPU; used by the process.           |
| **Physical Address** | Actual location in RAM.                          |
| **Page Table**       | Maps virtual pages to physical frames.           |
| **Page Fault**       | Triggered when the required page is not in RAM.  |
| **Swap Space**       | Area on the disk used to store pages not in RAM. |

## **Advantages of Virtual Memory**
- Enables large programs to run even if physical RAM is small.

- Improves CPU utilization via multitasking.

- Increases memory protection and isolation.

- Efficient memory use by loading only needed pages.

## **Disadvantages of Virtual Memory**
- Slower than RAM — Accessing data from disk is much slower.

- Thrashing — If too many pages are swapped in/out, performance degrades drastically.

- Disk Wear — Frequent read/write operations can wear out SSDs.

- More Complex OS Design — Requires sophisticated memory management algorithms.
