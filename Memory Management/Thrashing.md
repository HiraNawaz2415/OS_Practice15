# **What is Thrashing in Operating Systems?**
- Thrashing is a condition in an operating system where the CPU spends more time swapping pages in and out of memory (between RAM and disk) than executing actual processes.

- This happens when too many processes are competing for too little physical memory, leading to frequent page faults and very poor system performance.
---
## **Example**
Imagine your system is running 6 programs, but the RAM only has enough space for 3 at a time. 
If each program keeps requesting pages that aren't in memory, the OS has to constantly swap pages in and out from disk â€” 
and the CPU is "thrashing" (wasting time on memory management instead of actual work).

## **Why Thrashing Happens**

| Cause                                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ðŸ”¸ **Overcommitment of Memory**      | Too many processes are loaded than memory can support.       |
| ðŸ”¸ **High Page Fault Rate**          | Pages are being swapped constantly.                          |
| ðŸ”¸ **Lack of Locality of Reference** | Processes are not accessing memory in a predictable pattern. |
| ðŸ”¸ **Poor Page Replacement Policy**  | Inefficient selection of which pages to replace.             |

## **Symptoms of Thrashing**
- High page fault rate

- Extremely slow system performance

- Constant disk activity

- CPU usage high, but no real processing

- System appears to freeze or hang

---
## **Visual Analogy**
Process A needs Page 1 â†’ Page Fault â†’ Swap from disk
Process B needs Page 2 â†’ Page Fault â†’ Swap from disk
Process A needs Page 3 â†’ Page Fault again â†’ Swap back Page 1

CPU is busy swapping pages, not executing!
â†’ This is Thrashing.
---
## **How to Detect Thrashing**
- Monitor the page fault frequency.

- Use system tools like Task Manager, top, or vmstat to check swap usage.

- Sudden increase in disk I/O with drop in CPU throughput

## **How Operating Systems Handle Thrashing**
| Strategy                               | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  **Working Set Model**                | Limit the number of pages a process can use to those it frequently accesses. |
|  **Page Fault Frequency (PFF)**       | Reduce multiprogramming if page fault rate goes too high.                    |
|  **Swapping**                         | Temporarily move some processes entirely out of RAM.                         |
|  **Load Control**                     | Reduce number of active processes.                                           |
|  **Priority-Based Memory Allocation** | Give more memory to high-priority processes.                                 |
