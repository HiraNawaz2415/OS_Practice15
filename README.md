# üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems (OS) Concepts 

This repository demonstrates key concepts of **Operating Systems (OS)**, focusing on **CPU scheduling algorithms** implemented in C/C++. It's designed to help students and learners understand how modern OSes manage resources efficiently.

## What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an interface between a user and the computer hardware. It manages all hardware and software resources, enabling multiple applications to run simultaneously while maintaining efficiency and fairness.

### Key Roles of an OS:
- **Process Management**: Handles running processes (programs in execution), including creation, scheduling, and termination.
- **Memory Management**: Allocates and tracks memory usage for processes.
- **File System Management**: Manages how data is stored and retrieved on storage devices.
- **Device Management**: Controls input/output devices.
- **Security and Access Control**: Protects system resources from unauthorized access.
- **User Interface**: Provides CLI or GUI for users to interact with the system.

##  How to Run

1. Install [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) or any C++ compiler.
2. Open any `.cpp` file in Dev-C++.
3. Compile & Run the program (`F11` in Dev-C++).
4. Follow the console prompts to enter process data.
