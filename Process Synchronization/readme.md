# What is Process Synchronization?
When multiple processes are running at the same time and they share data or resoruces, they can interfere with each other if not controlled.
Process Synchronization is the technique to coordinate these processes so that:

   - No data is lost
   - No inconsistency occurs
   - Processes cooperate without conflict

- Process Synchronization means managing the order and timing of multiple processes that access shared resources (like memory, files, or variables), so that data remains correct and consistent.

- In simple words, it makes sure that when multiple processes are working together, they don‚Äôt get in each other‚Äôs way.



---
**Example:**

Imagine two people (processes) updating a shared Google Doc (shared data).
If both type at the same time in the same area, the document can get corrupted or confused.
Similarly, in OS, processes may:

- Share files

- Update the same memory/data

- Access printers, databases, etc.

If not synchronized, this leads to Race Conditions

---
## Why Process Synchronization is Needed?
**Shared Resources:** When multiple processes access shared resources (e.g., memory, files, variables), synchronization prevents conflicts.

**Data Consistency:** Ensures that data is not corrupted due to simultaneous access by multiple processes.

**Race Conditions:** Avoids situations where the output depends on the unpredictable timing of processes.

---
## **What is a Race Condition?**

A race condition occurs when:

  - Multiple processes read/write shared data
  - The final result depends on who finishes first

**Example:**

Let‚Äôs say x = 10

Process A: x = x + 1 ‚Üí (reads 10, adds 1 ‚Üí x = 11)

Process B: x = x * 2 ‚Üí (reads 10, multiplies by 2 ‚Üí x = 20)

If both do it at the same time without sync, result might be:

x = 22 ‚ùå (wrong)
x = 20 ‚úÖ

x = 11 ‚úÖ

Which is unpredictable and dangerous.

## **Critical Section Problem**
A critical section is a part of the program where the process accesses shared resources. Only one process should be allowed in its critical section at a time.
If multiple processes enter their critical sections at the same time, it may cause data corruption or unexpected behavior.

- A solution to the critical section problem must satisfy:

**Mutual Exclusion:** Only one process can enter the critical section at a time.

**Progress:** If no process is in the critical section, one of the waiting processes should enter.

**Bounded Waiting:** There should be a limit on how long a process waits to enter the critical section.

# **Synchronization Techniques**

## **1. Software-based Solutions**
  - Peterson‚Äôs Algorithm (used for two processes)
  - Dekker‚Äôs Algorithm

## **2. Hardware-based Solutions**
 - Test-and-Set Instruction
 - Compare-and-Swap Instruction
 - Disabling Interrupts (not recommended for multiprocessor systems)

## **3. Synchronization Tools (provided by OS)**

### **Semaphores:**
   - Integer variable used to signal between processes.
   - wait() and signal() operations control access.

**Types:** Binary Semaphore (mutex), Counting Semaphore.

### **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Object):**

   - A locking mechanism to ensure mutual exclusion.

### **Monitors:**

   - High-level synchronization construct with shared variables, condition variables, and functions to safely access them.

### **Condition Variables:**

   - Used with monitors for signaling between processes when a condition becomes true.

## **Main Critical Section Problems**

## **1. ü•´ Producer-Consumer Problem**
**Problem:**
- Producer adds data to a buffer.

- Consumer removes data from the buffer.

- The buffer has limited size.
**Real-Life Example:**
- Imagine a chef (producer) making food and putting it on a table (buffer). A waiter (consumer) picks up the food and serves it.
- The table can only hold a limited number of plates.
**Issues:**
- Producer must wait if the buffer is full.

- Consumer must wait if the buffer is empty.


**Solution:**

- Use:

     - Semaphore empty = number of empty slots
     - Semaphore full = number of filled slots
     - Mutex to protect buffer access

**Synchronization Flow:**

- Producer: wait(empty) ‚Üí wait(mutex) ‚Üí add item ‚Üí signal(mutex) ‚Üí signal(full)
- Consumer: wait(full)  ‚Üí wait(mutex) ‚Üí remove item ‚Üí signal(mutex) ‚Üí signal(empty)

## **2. üìñ Reader-Writer Problem**
**Problem:**
 - Multiple readers can read at the same time.
 - Only one writer can write.
 - No reader or writer should access the file during writing.

**Issues:**
- Writers need exclusive access.

- Readers can be allowed together, only if no writer is writing.

**Real-Life Example:**
- A library where many people can read a book together, but if someone wants to edit the book, they need exclusive access.

**Solution:**
- Use:
    - A mutex for writer acces
    - A readCount variable to track number of readers
    - Semaphores to block or allow processes

**Variants:**
- First readers problem: Writers may starve.

- First writers problem: Readers may starve.
- Fair solution: Balanced reader-writer access.

## 3. üç¥ Dining Philosophers Problem

### Problem:
- 5 philosophers sit at a table with 5 forks.
- Each needs **2 forks** to eat.
- Forks are shared between neighbors.

### Issues:
- If all philosophers pick one fork ‚Üí **Deadlock**
- Some may eat more than others ‚Üí **Starvation**

### Solution:
- Use **mutexes/semaphores** for fork access.
- Allow only 4 philosophers to eat at a time.
- Use a **waiter/arbitrator** to manage access.

---

## 4. Bounded Buffer Problem

### Problem:
Similar to Producer-Consumer, but emphasizes the **fixed buffer size**.

### Solution:
- Same as Producer-Consumer using:
  - `Mutex`
  - `Full` and `Empty` semaphores

---

## 5. üíà Sleeping Barber Problem

### Problem:
- Barber sleeps if no customers.
- If chairs are full, customers leave.
- If not, customers wait and barber serves one by one.

### Solution:
Use:
- `Semaphore customers`
- `Semaphore barbers`
- `Mutex` to access shared waiting chairs

---

## 6. üö¨ Cigarette Smoker Problem

### Problem:
- 3 smokers: one has paper, one has tobacco, one has matches.
- An agent places two of the three items on the table.
- The smoker with the third item makes and smokes a cigarette.

### Solution:
- Use semaphores to signal the correct smoker to proceed.
